Since finishing university, I have decided to revisit some of the content which I remember particularly struggling with. Cheeringly, I haven't found it nearly as difficult now as I did at the time. To consolidate things, I've taken to writing notes on selected topics of interest, and I thought it would be fun to upload very lightly-edited versions of those notes. This is as much an exercise in writing as it is in mathematics: as anyone who knew me at university can attest, my mathematical writing was *verbose* - I routinely received notes on my work instructing me to write less. I felt the need to understand, and record, every minute detail of every argument. These notes are an attempt at concision. And hopefully in looking back I can offer some interesting perspective on classic undergraduate topics.

Health warning: 
  - If this experiment is successful, these posts will be terse.
  - Because this is a retrospective, the content may be conceptually out of order and there may be significant logical gaps between posts.
  - Do not expect notational consistency; my choice of notation is likely to follow whatever textbook or set of notes I have been following last.
