Nilpotent and solvable groups are very important concepts but for some reason the basic definitions and results always give me a little more trouble than they should[^lie]. Here I record the fundamentals.

# Definitions (many)

# Some basic results



[^lie]: Actually, I was exposed to the definition of nilpotence and most of these propositions in the context of Lie algebras first, but I think it's nicer to learn about them in the context of groups.
